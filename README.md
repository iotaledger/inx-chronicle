Chronicle is the permanode (sometimes also called indexer or scanner) for the IOTA-based networks.
It connects to a [Hornet](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet) via the [IOTA Node Extension (INX)](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx) interface.
Through the INX interface, Chronicle listens to all blocks in the Tangle that are confirmed and stores them in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

## Documentation

The documentation for Chronicle can be found in [our wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/chronicle/welcome), the supported APIs are documented [here](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/chronicle/reference/api).

## Development

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automatically generate a [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/iotaledger/inx-chronicle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) which signals breaking changes.
The changelog can be created using the following command (requires the [`conventional-changelog-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli) package on NPM):
```sh
conventional-changelog -p conventionalcommits -i CHANGELOG.md -s
```

## Docker deployment configuration of credentials through environment variables

Docker compose will automatically load credentials for different services from a `.env` file that must either be located in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file, or specified using the `--env-file` flag. You therefore must create such a file before you do a `docker compose up`. An example `.env` file could look like this:

```ini
MONGODB_USERNAME=root
MONGODB_PASSWORD=root
INFLUXDB_USERNAME=root
INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=password
JWT_PASSWORD=password
JWT_SALT=saltines
HORNET_CONFIG_PATH=config_testnet.json
```
